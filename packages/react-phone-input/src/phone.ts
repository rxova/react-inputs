 * US number because it carries the assignment rules for every carrier block in
 * the world — that is what its metadata buys, and why a field built on it is
 * ~41 kB brotli. This tells you the digits are the right length for the country,
 * which is what a form field actually needs to stop a typo, and the whole
 * component is 3.9 kB. The README says so in the same words; the prop is
 * `possible`, never `valid`.
