/**
 * A ~1 kB entropy estimator.
 *
 * The incumbent in this space is zxcvbn, which is excellent and costs ~350 kB
 * minified + brotli (measured, not quoted) because it ships wordlists. That trade is right for a password *auditor* and
 * wrong for a signup form: the meter is a nudge, not an authorisation decision,
 * and the real defences (length floor, breach-corpus check, rate limiting) live
 * elsewhere. So this estimator models the four things a wordlist-free estimator
 * can model honestly — character pool, length, structural repetition, and
 * explicitly supplied context — and gets out of the way. The `estimate` prop
 * swaps in zxcvbn for anyone who wants the wordlists.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of its arguments. No `Date`, no
 * `Math.random`, no locale: the same password always scores the same, which is
 * what makes the buckets testable and the meter non-flickery.
