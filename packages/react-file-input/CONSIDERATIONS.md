# Considerations — `@rxova/react-file-input`

Decisions I made without asking, and why. Each is reversible; flag any you disagree with.

## Naming and placement

- **`@rxova/react-file-input`**, matching the sibling packages. Not "dropzone" or "uploader": it
  is a _field_, it participates in a form, and it uploads nothing.
- Component `FileInput`, hook `useFileInput`, `data-rx-file-*` attributes, warning prefix
  `[react-file-input]`, demo on ports 5283/4183 — the next free slot in the repo's sequence.
- Pure helpers (`attempt`, `attemptAll`, `matchesAccept`, `formatBytes`, `describeRejection`,
  `fileKey`, `extensionOf`, `isPreviewable`) are exported. They are useful for server-side
  revalidation of the same rules, and testing them directly is cheaper than through the DOM.

## The accessible shape

- **The drop zone is a `<button type="button">`, not a `div`.** Dragging has no keyboard
  equivalent, so the click path is the only accessible path; a button supplies Enter, Space, focus
  and a role for free.
- **The real `<input type="file">` stays in the DOM**, hidden by the visually-hidden clip
  technique. `display: none` or the `hidden` attribute would take it out of the accessibility tree
  and, in some browsers, stop `.click()` opening the picker.
- **The hidden input is `tabIndex={-1}`.** It is visually hidden, so a Tab that stopped on it put
  focus where nobody could see it. It stays focusable from script, for the forwarded ref and a
  native `required` check.
- **Explicit `tabIndex={0}`** on the drop zone and every remove button: WebKit omits buttons from
  sequential navigation unless Full Keyboard Access is on.
- **The drop zone is named after the field.** It is the one tab stop, and three file fields named
  by their hint alone all read "Choose a file or drop it here". Its `aria-labelledby` points at a
  hidden span holding `aria-label ?? label`, then at itself. Not at the input: Chromium then adds
  the input's value text, "Import file: No file chosen Drop a file here". A browser test reads
  Chromium's own accessibility tree over CDP to hold this, since the JavaScript name algorithm
  passes either way.
- **Focus after a removal** goes to the next file's button, else the previous, else the drop zone.
- **The list is a `<ul>`**, so a screen reader announces "list, 3 items".
- **Remove buttons are named after their file** — `Remove invoice.pdf`, overridable via
  `removeLabel`.
- **Previews are `alt=""`.** The filename is right beside them; alt text would be read twice.
- **One polite announcement per batch.** Attaching four files says so once, not four times.
- Remove buttons are laid out at 24×24 CSS pixels minimum (WCAG 2.5.8), asserted in both the
  component and the page-level suites.

## Rules and rejection

- **Identity is `name:size:lastModified`**, matching what the native control treats as the same
  file. Content hashing would be correct and would also mean reading every byte of every file.
- **`accept` is lenient when the browser reports no MIME type.** Some platforms hand over an empty
  `type` for perfectly ordinary files; refusing those would be worse than occasionally admitting
  one, and the extension check still applies.
- **Sizes are decimal** (`1 kB` = 1000 bytes), which is what every operating system's file browser
  shows the user.
- **Unusable bounds are dropped, not enforced.** `maxFiles: 0`, a negative `minSize`, an inverted
  size range — each is ignored and reported through `onWarn`. A field that can never accept
  anything is a bug in the caller's code, not a state worth rendering.
- **`validate` is contained.** A throwing validator refuses that one file and warns; it never
  unmounts the form.
- **A refused file leaves the rest alone.** Five picked, two refused, three added — with one
  `onReject` call each.
- **A single-file field replaces rather than appends**, because the native control holds one file
  and showing two would misreport what a submit would post.

## Previews

- **Off by default.** An object URL nobody revokes is a memory leak; opting in should be a
  deliberate act.
- **Images only.** Everything else has no meaningful thumbnail without decoding it.
- **Never minted on the server.** There is no unmount during server rendering, so such a URL could
  never be revoked — and it would be meaningless in the HTML anyway.
- The URL map is _mutated_, never replaced: the unmount cleanup captures it once, and swapping in
  a fresh map would leave that cleanup holding an empty one. (This was a real bug, caught by the
  adversarial suite.)

## Props and value

- **The value is `File[]`**, never a wrapper object. `File` is the thing `FormData` and `fetch`
  take, and inventing `{ id, file, status }` would make every consumer unwrap it.
- **Controlled and uncontrolled both supported**, `value` winning when present.
- **The native input holds only files the field is showing.** A browser fires `change` only when a
  pick differs from what the input holds, so a refused file, a removed one, or one a controlled
  parent dropped could not be picked again while it stayed there. Blanking the value after every
  pick is the usual trick, but it also empties the control a native form submit posts — the field
  would then render a file the server never receives. Instead, after each render the input's
  files are rebuilt through `DataTransfer` to drop whatever the field does not show: a partly
  refused pick keeps the accepted files. It runs after render because a controlled parent decides
  `files`.
- **No stylesheet.** Structural inline styles only, with `data-*` hooks covered by semver, matching
  the rest of the repo.
- **`renderFile` replaces a row but keeps the remove button**, so a custom renderer cannot
  accidentally drop the only way to detach a file.

## Testing

- Coverage is enforced **per file** at 95%. `/* v8 ignore */` appears three times, each on a
  genuinely unreachable branch (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` fallbacks, the production-stripped
  diagnostics body) and each with a comment saying why.
- The adversarial suite drives the failure modes on purpose: throwing callbacks, unmounting
  mid-drag, duplicate picks, the URL leak, two fields on one page, a `dragleave` from a child.
- E2E runs 28 specs on Chromium, Firefox and WebKit against a **production** demo build. One of
  them asserts the diagnostics path is absent from that bundle.
- Where an engine cannot express something (synthesising a file `DataTransfer`), the test
  `test.skip()`s **visibly** rather than passing quietly.

## Known limitations

- **Dedupe across two separate picks cannot be exercised through Playwright's `setInputFiles`**,
  which stamps each uploaded buffer with the current time — so the same file picked twice is
  genuinely two files. That path is covered through the drop event instead.
- **In `multiple` mode a native form submit posts only the last selection**, because the native
  control can hold only what the last pick gave it. Read `value`/`onChange` if you accumulate.
- **No directory drops.** `DataTransferItem.webkitGetAsEntry` traversal is uneven across engines
  and unbounded in depth.
- **No upload, progress or retry.** Out of scope by design — see the manifest.
- **`dragover` does not move the drag-depth counter, and must be bound separately from
  `dragenter`.** A browser repeats `dragover` for as long as the pointer hovers, so counting it
  makes the depth climb without bound and the highlight never clears. It still has to be prevented
  on every tick, or the browser refuses the drop.
- **A drop carrying no files is left to the browser**, matching the drag handlers rather than
  swallowing the page's own default for a dragged link.
