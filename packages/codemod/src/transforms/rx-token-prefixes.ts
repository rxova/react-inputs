/**
 * jscodeshift transform: move the 1.0 styling hooks into their namespaces.
 *
 * `@rxova/react-otp-input` renamed `--otp-*` to `--rx-otp-*` and `data-otp-*` to
 * `data-rx-otp-*`; `@rxova/react-rating-input` renamed `--rfs-*` and `data-rfs-*`
 * the same way. Only those two packages are covered, because they are the only
 * two whose old names ever shipped.
 *
 * **This one rewrites text and never parses.** Two reasons, and the second is
 * the one that matters:
 *
 * 1. A hyphen cannot appear in a JavaScript identifier, so `--otp-` and
 *    `data-otp-` are unambiguous wherever they occur — in a style-object key, a
 *    `var()` fallback, a `querySelector` argument, a styled-components template,
 *    a Tailwind arbitrary variant, a JSX attribute name, or a comment. There is
 *    no context where the substring means something this rename should spare.
 *    Going through the AST found strictly fewer of them, and recast reprints
 *    every literal it touches with its own quote style — turning a token rename
 *    into a diff across every string in the file, in a codebase that has already
 *    decided about quotes.
 *
 * 2. Not parsing means this runs over `.css`, `.scss` and `.module.css` too,
 *    which is where most of these names actually live. jscodeshift only parses
 *    when a transform asks it to, so passing `--extensions css,tsx,ts` works:
 *
 *        npx @rxova/codemod rx-token-prefixes --extensions css,tsx,ts,jsx,js src
 *
 * Applying it twice is a no-op: `--rx-otp-` does not contain `--otp-`.
