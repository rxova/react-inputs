 * The single source of truth for which transforms `@rxova/codemod` ships.

 * Each `name` must match a file at `src/transforms/<name>.ts` (built to
 * `dist/transforms/<name>.cjs`); the dispatcher in `bin.ts` resolves it by that
 * convention and jscodeshift loads the built file. Add a migration by dropping a
 * transform in `src/transforms/` and listing it here.
