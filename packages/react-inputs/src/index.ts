// Meta-package: re-exports every rxova input component so consumers can
// `npm i @rxova/react-inputs` and import the whole suite from one entry point.
export * from '@rxova/react-intl-currency-input'
export * from '@rxova/react-rating-input'
export * from '@rxova/react-otp-input'
export * from '@rxova/react-phone-input'
export * from '@rxova/react-password-input'
export * from '@rxova/react-timezone-input'

/*
 * The remaining four export by name rather than with a star, because exactly six
 * of their *pure helpers* collide across packages:
 *
 *   date + time  ->  toISO, fromISO, compareISO, withinRange
 *   tags + file  ->  attempt, attemptAll
 *
 * Those names are correct in their own package and meaningless once merged into
 * one namespace — `toISO` would have to mean both a date and a time. A star
 * export makes them ambiguous (silently absent at runtime under ESM, an error
 * under some bundlers), so those six stay where they are: import them from
 * `@rxova/react-date-input` and friends directly.
 *
 * Everything else comes through, including every type. The list below used to be
 * hand-picked, which made it wrong in a way nothing reported: `onPartsChange` is
 * typed `(parts: DateParts) => void` and was re-exported, while `DateParts`
 * itself was not — so a consumer of this package could see the prop and had no
 * way to name its argument. `meta-package.test.ts` now fails on any export that
 * is not either re-exported here or one of the six collisions.
