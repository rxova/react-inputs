/**
 * Calendar arithmetic on plain numbers and ISO strings. No `Date` objects.
 *
 * That is the whole point of this module. `new Date('2026-03-01')` parses as
 * **UTC midnight**, while `new Date(2026, 2, 1)` parses as *local* midnight, so
 * the moment a date-only value touches a `Date` it acquires a timezone it never
 * had — and west of UTC, `new Date('2026-03-01').getDate()` is 28. That single
 * discrepancy is the source of most "my date picker is a day off" bug reports in
 * every library that models a calendar date as an instant.
 *
 * A calendar date is a year, a month and a day. It is not a point in time. So
 * this module never constructs one, and the values it produces are `YYYY-MM-DD`
 * strings — which, conveniently, sort lexicographically in exactly the same
 * order they sort chronologically, so range comparisons are string comparisons.
