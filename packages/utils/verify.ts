 * since some ref", which has no good answer mid-rebase (detached HEAD), after a
 * cherry-pick (the range spans unrelated commits) or on a merge (two parents).
 * Turbo instead hashes the actual file contents that feed each task, so a
 * rebased, cherry-picked or merged tree that ends up byte-identical replays the
 * cache, and one that does not re-runs exactly the packages that differ. There
 * is no git state that can make it silently under-check.
 *
 * The non-Turbo steps get the same property from their own content caches:
 * eslint and prettier both key on file content + config, so an unchanged file
 * is never re-read.
