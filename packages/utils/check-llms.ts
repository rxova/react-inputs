/**
 * Fails if a published package's `llms.txt` is missing, malformed, or has drifted
 * from the props it documents.
 *
 * These files ship inside the tarball, so they are what a coding agent reads out
 * of `node_modules` after an install. That makes their failure mode unusually
 * quiet: a prop renamed in `types.ts` leaves the table describing an API that no
 * longer exists, every test still passes, and the reader most likely to be misled
 * is the one least able to notice. Nothing else in the repo looks at these files.
 *
 * So the check that earns its keep is the last one — every prop named in the
 * table must actually be a member of the component's props interface. The rest
 * are structural, and mostly catch a file copy-pasted from a sibling package.
 *
 * Snippet correctness is NOT checked here: `check-doc-snippets.ts` already
 * enumerates every package llms.txt and type-transpiles each fence, and the
 * rxova.org links are resolved against the built site by the docs build's
 * `check-readme-links.mjs`. One rule, one place.
 *
 * ## The root index
 *
 * `llms.txt` at the repository root is a different document with a different
 * reader: an agent that arrived through the repository tree rather than through
 * an install, for whom `AGENTS.md` is the wrong file — it is written for someone
 * editing the suite. That index is pointer-only by design, so the one thing in
 * it that can rot is a link, and the one link that rots unattended is a
 * package's: add a tenth component and nothing would otherwise notice the map
 * still shows nine. `checkRootIndex` is only that.
 *
 * Offline: reads files only.
 *
 * Usage: `node --import tsx ./packages/utils/check-llms.ts [repoRoot]`.
