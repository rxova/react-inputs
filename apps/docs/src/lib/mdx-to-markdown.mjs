// Turn a docs page's MDX source into plain markdown, for the `.md` twin every
// page is served at (see src/pages/[...slug].md.ts).
//
// ## Why normalize the source rather than render and convert back
//
// Rendering to HTML and converting back would need a new dependency, and it would
// reformat every code fence on the way through — and the fences are the single
// thing an agent reading these pages actually wants verbatim. The body already is
// markdown for almost all of its bytes. What is left is a closed set of MDX
// constructs, listed in the rules below; `scripts/check-md-routes.mjs` fails the
// build if a page grows one this file does not handle, so the set cannot quietly
// drift.
//
// ## The rule that matters
//
// Almost every `import` line in this content sits INSIDE a code fence — they are
// the illustrative snippets the docs are made of. Only a handful are real MDX imports.
// So no rule may be applied blindly across the document: everything runs through
// `mapUnfenced`, and a fence's contents are never touched. Getting this wrong
// silently guts the examples, which is exactly the failure an agent would not
// notice and would then repeat.
