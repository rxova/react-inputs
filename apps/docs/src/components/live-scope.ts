/**
 * Everything available inside a ```tsx live code block. Spreading React exposes
 * the hooks (useState, etc.) directly, and every component's exports make the
 * suite usable without an import statement (react-live cannot process imports).
 *
 * Spread by namespace rather than symbol by symbol: a component's new export
 * used to need a matching edit here, and the failure was a runtime "X is not
 * defined" inside a doc example — visible only to whoever next opened that
 * page. Adding an input is two lines here, and its exports then follow on their
 * own.
 *
 * Not discovered by glob, unlike the playground's routes: these are bare
 * package specifiers resolved by the bundler, and `import.meta.glob` only
 * matches file paths.
