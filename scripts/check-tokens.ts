/**
 * Fails when a component emits a styling hook outside its own namespace.
 *
 * Every CSS custom property and every structural `data-*` attribute a component
 * paints is public API — `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` both say so, and the
 * whole styling story is "there is no stylesheet, target these instead". So the
 * names are a compatibility surface, and until this check existed each package
 * picked its own prefix from its initials. That produced `--rpi-` for password
 * and `--rphi-` for phone, `--rfs-` for rating and `--rfi-` for file: pairs one
 * character apart, on components that routinely appear in the same form. Custom
 * properties inherit, so setting the wrong one is inert rather than an error —
 * the failure mode is a knob that silently does nothing.
 *
 * The rule: a hook is either namespaced `--rx-<slug>-*` / `data-rx-<slug>-*`
 * with the package's own slug, or it is one of the shared state hooks below,
 * which mean the same thing everywhere and are deliberately not namespaced —
 * `[data-invalid]` should style every input in the suite with one selector.
 *
 * Text-scanned rather than parsed. These names are string literals in JSX
 * attributes and in `var()` calls inside style objects, so a regex sees exactly
 * what ships; a TypeScript AST walk would have to reassemble the same strings
 * from template literals to learn less.
 *
 * Scans what the component paints, not `__tests__`: a test legitimately passes
 * arbitrary `data-*` through the component to prove it forwards them, and a
 * stale selector in a test already fails loudly by querying nothing.
 *
 * Offline: reads files only.
 *
 * Usage: `node --import tsx ./scripts/check-tokens.ts [repoRoot]`.
