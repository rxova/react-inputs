/**
 * The component registry, discovered rather than declared centrally.
 *
 * A component package identifies itself with an `rxova` block in its own
 * package.json:
 *
 *   "rxova": { "slug": "otp", "label": "OTP", "title": "OTP input" }
 *
 * Nothing here lists the packages, and neither does anything downstream — the
 * docs sidebar, the CI matrices and the playground all read this. Adding an
 * input means creating its directory; the tooling picks it up on the next run.
 *
 * The alternative, a central array, is the shape this repo kept drifting out of
 * sync with: a package could be published, documented and demoed while quietly
 * missing from a CI matrix, and nothing failed — the job just never ran for it.
 * A missing self-declaration is loud by comparison, because the package appears
 * nowhere at all.
 *
 * `.mjs` because the consumers are `.mjs` (astro.config, CI scripts) and plain
 * Node. Deliberately dependency-free and synchronous: it runs inside an Astro
 * config load and inside a GitHub Actions step.

 * route segment, `label` the sidebar entry, `title` a human heading.
 *
 * Display order is derived, not declared: a package's position in the list is
 * not a fact about that package, so nothing here asks it to name one. Sorting
 * by the displayed label keeps the order self-evident and stable as inputs come
 * and go — the alternative, a per-package `order` number, is a central ordered
 * list smeared across the manifests, the coupling this registry exists to shed.
