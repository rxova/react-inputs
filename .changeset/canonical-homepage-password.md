'@rxova/react-password-input': patch
---

Point `homepage` at the canonical documentation URL instead of the short route.

`/packages/react-inputs/password` is not a dead link — `astro.config.mjs` emits a `/{slug}` redirect for every component, so it has always resolved. But it resolves through a meta-refresh stub, and it was only six of the nine: currency, OTP and rating already pointed straight at `/components/{slug}/introduction/`. Since `homepage` is what npm renders as the package page's home link, that click now lands on the destination rather than on a hop, and the field reads the same way across the suite.
