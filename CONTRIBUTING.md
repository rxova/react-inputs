Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## Architecture

A pnpm + Turborepo monorepo: several published packages, one shared playground, and one shared
docs site.

| Path                                  | What lives there                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `packages/react-intl-currency-input/` | `@rxova/react-intl-currency-input` — locale-aware currency input.                    |
| `packages/react-rating-input/`        | `@rxova/react-rating-input` — rating input (stars / any icon).                       |
| `packages/react-otp-input/`           | `@rxova/react-otp-input` — OTP / one-time-code input.                                |
| `packages/react-phone-input/`         | `@rxova/react-phone-input` — international phone input.                              |
| `packages/react-password-input/`      | `@rxova/react-password-input` — password input, strength meter, reveal toggle.       |
| `packages/react-date-input/`          | `@rxova/react-date-input` — segmented date field, no calendar.                       |
| `packages/react-time-input/`          | `@rxova/react-time-input` — segmented time field, no popup.                          |
| `packages/react-tags-input/`          | `@rxova/react-tags-input` — tag / token input.                                       |
| `packages/react-file-input/`          | `@rxova/react-file-input` — file picker and drop zone (no uploading).                |
| `packages/react-timezone-input/`      | `@rxova/react-timezone-input` — IANA time zone picker, no tz database.               |
| `packages/react-inputs/`              | `@rxova/react-inputs` — meta-package that re-exports the whole suite.                |
| `packages/codemod/`                   | `@rxova/codemod` — jscodeshift codemods (one transform per migration) for the suite. |
| `packages/utils/`                     | `@rxova/utils` — private tooling (release gate, doc-snippet checks, capture, etc.).  |
| `packages/*/src/__tests__/`           | `*.test.ts(x)` run in node, `*.browser.test.tsx` run in Chromium.                    |
| `packages/*/e2e/`                     | Playwright specs, per package, against the built shared playground.                  |
| `apps/playground/`                    | `@rxova/playground` — Vite app for manual QA and the E2E target.                     |
| `apps/docs/`                          | `@rxova/docs` — Astro Starlight site for the whole suite.                            |

Each component package follows the same shape: pure logic modules with no React, a headless
`use*` hook holding state, a thin rendering component, a `types.ts` public prop surface, and
tests. `types.ts` and the `data-*` attributes listed in each README are public API, covered by
semver.

## Setup

Requirements:

- **Developing this repo: Node `>= 22.13`** (see `.nvmrc`, pinned to 24). This is a pnpm
  constraint — pnpm 11 imports `node:sqlite` and crashes on older Node.
- **Using the published packages: Node `>= 20.19`** (`engines.node`). CI still runs the unit
  suites on Node 20 so the support claim stays tested rather than assumed.
- pnpm, pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run e2e:install                    # browsers for the E2E and browser suites
pnpm dev                                # shared playground on :5173
```

## Commands

Orchestrated by Turborepo, so tasks run in dependency order and cache across packages.

```bash
pnpm build             # turbo run build — every package, ^build ordered
pnpm test              # unit + browser suites across packages
pnpm test:coverage     # enforces 95% per file
pnpm e2e               # Playwright per package, max three suites at once
pnpm e2e:serial        # Same suites, one package at a time for constrained machines
pnpm lint / typecheck / format
pnpm size              # bundle-size budgets
pnpm check:exports     # publint + attw
```

Scope to one package with a filter: `pnpm --filter @rxova/react-otp-input test:browser`.

### Which suite does a test belong in?

- **Pure logic / arithmetic** → `src/__tests__/*.test.ts`, node project. Fast, no DOM.
- **Geometry, clipping, hover, focus, caret, paste** → `*.browser.test.tsx`, Chromium. jsdom has
  no layout engine and a fictional selection model, so a jsdom assertion there only re-reads the
  style string we just wrote. Never add jsdom for these.
- **Server rendering** → `src/__tests__/ssr.test.tsx`, node project.
- **Anything that needs a whole page** — tab order across several fields, a real form round-trip,
  page-level RTL, axe over the full document → the package's `e2e/`. This layer catches things
  component tests structurally cannot.

## Pre-PR checklist

CI runs, in order:

1. `audit:check` · `dedupe:check`
2. `format:check` · `lint` · `typecheck`
3. `test:coverage` — **95% per file**, so a new file with thin tests fails even if the repo
   average is fine
4. `build` · `check:exports` (publint + attw) · `pack:smoke`
5. `size` · `e2e`

Also:

- **Add a changeset** for anything user-facing: `pnpm exec changeset`. It will ask which packages
  changed. Docs/CI-only PRs can carry the `skip-changeset` label instead.
- **If you changed behaviour, change the prose in the same PR.** Grep the package README and the
  docs for the prop you touched. A fix that ships with docs still teaching the old behaviour ships
  invisible.
- **Run both gates before handoff.** `pnpm verify` is the local pre-push/release gate; whole-page
  Playwright suites are intentionally separate, so follow it with `pnpm e2e`.

## Rules

- **Zero runtime dependencies.** `react` stays the only peer dependency (plus `react-dom` where a
  package needs it). A PR adding a runtime dependency needs a very good argument.
- **No stylesheet to import.** Only layout-critical CSS is inlined; everything visual is a CSS
  custom property or a `data-*` hook.
- **Accessibility is not optional.** Each component leans on real platform semantics (a
  `radiogroup` of real radios, real `<input>`s) so the browser provides keyboard, focus, and form
  behaviour. Reimplementing one of those in JavaScript is a signal the markup is wrong.
- The `data-*` attributes in each README are **public API** and covered by semver.
- **Namespace the styling hooks.** A component's custom properties and structural attributes are
  `--rx-<slug>-*` and `data-rx-<slug>-*`, where `<slug>` is the `rxova.slug` in its own
  package.json. State hooks that mean the same thing everywhere — `data-invalid`, `data-disabled`,
  `data-readonly`, `data-focused` — stay unprefixed, so one selector reaches every input in the
  suite. `pnpm check:tokens` enforces it; before it existed the suite drifted into `--rpi-` for
  password and `--rphi-` for phone, one character apart on two fields that share a sign-up form.
- Conventional Commits, enforced by `commitlint` locally and on PRs.

## Release

Automated with Changesets. **Releases run in CI, not locally.**

1. Merge to `main`.
2. The Release workflow opens or updates a version PR with the bumps and changelogs.
3. Merging that PR runs the gate, then publishes changed packages to npm with provenance via OIDC
   trusted publishing — there is no npm token in the repo.

Adding a changeset is the only step you do by hand:

```bash
pnpm exec changeset            # pick the packages + bump, describe the user-visible change
```

`pnpm exec changeset version` is deliberately **not** part of the local workflow: the changelog is
generated by `@changesets/changelog-github`, which needs a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to resolve commits and
contributors. CI supplies it. To preview a bump locally, export a personal access token first.

### Writing a changeset

One changeset per release-worthy change, written for someone reading the changelog — not the diff.
Before a release, re-read the pending files together: they land in a single changelog entry per
package, so a later change that supersedes an earlier one should edit that earlier file rather
than add a contradicting entry.
